# JavaScript Basics through Debugging

The purpose of this library is to teach basic programming concepts through
debugging JavaScript code in a real browser environment. Debugging is an
important skill for all programmers, and I believe learning how to solve bugs
from the start is the ideal way to get into programming.

To use this tutorial, simply open the index.html file using Chrome and follow
the instructions on the webpage.

This tutorial is still in development, so if you do end up using it please let
me know if encounter any bugs that are unintentional.
